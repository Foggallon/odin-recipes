    <h2><strong>What is Jambalaya?</strong></h2>
    <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables.
         With French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella.
         The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provencal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
    <p>Like many Cajun and Creole foods, jambalaya starts with the Cajun holy trinity: a flavor base of onion, bell peppers, and celery.</p>
