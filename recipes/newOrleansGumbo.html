    <h2 class="header">What is Gumbo</h2>
    <p>Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.</p>
    <p>As varied as the recipes can be, there are a few ingredients that all gumbos have in common: homemade stock; the "holy trinity" of celery, onions, and green peppers; and roux. </p>
    <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup bacon drippings</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 large onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound andouille sausage, sliced</li>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salte to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce(eg. <em>Tabasco</em>), or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 (<em>14.5 ounce</em>) can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (<em>6 ounce</em>) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon dripings</li>
        <li>2 (<em>10 ounce</em>) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white cinegar</li>
        <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
        <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Make the roux:</strong> Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. </li>
        <li><strong>Make the gumbo:</strong> Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. </li>
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water. </li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong> heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. </li>
        <li><strong>Meanwhile</strong>, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo. </li>
        <li><strong>Mix</strong> in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving. </li>
    </ol>
