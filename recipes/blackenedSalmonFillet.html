    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blackened salmon is made using a cooking technique where fish fillets are liberally seasoned with a cajun spice rub then pan seared in a hot skillet until fairly well darkened (or blackened) on the exterior.</p>
    <p>A beautiful crisp crust is formed and it has a nice hint of a charred flavor which highlight its more mellow interior.</p>
